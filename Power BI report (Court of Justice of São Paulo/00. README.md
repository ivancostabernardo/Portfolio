Among the various Power BI reports I produced during my time at the Court of Justice of São Paulo, this one holds special significance for me because it went beyond the boundaries of the institution, allowing the public to monitor the performance of an important public service. The indicators displayed are derived from Resolution No. 76/2009 of the National Council of Justice of Brazil, which establishes standardized indicators for courts across the country, enhancing the transparency of the Judiciary, as well as the comparability and reliability of the data.
The report can be accessed on the [website of Court of Justice of São Paulo](https://www.tjsp.jus.br/Estatistica/Estatistica/Res76).
